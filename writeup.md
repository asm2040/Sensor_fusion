# Writeup: Track 3D-Objects Over Time

Please use this starter template to answer the following questions:

### 1. Write a short recap of the four tracking steps and what you implemented there (filter, track management, association, camera fusion). Which results did you achieve? Which part of the project was most difficult for you to complete, and why?
1.which resulys did you achieve?

For loop_over_dataset.py, student/objdet_pcl.py, student/objdet_detect.py, student/objdet_eval.py
I achieve association and camera fusion

2.Which part of the project was most difficult for you to complete, and why?

In section 4, calculating precision and recall is difficult for me 
I do it with my everyting and can't find the difference with  correct answer that i thought if i do this way, i can make that
I want to know that what section is uncorrect 

### 2. Do you see any benefits in camera-lidar fusion compared to lidar-only tracking (in theory and in your concrete results)? 
I think lidar-only tracking is hard to decting and tracking in moving enviroment
but with sensor fusion, it's better. Becasue if one is not correct, the other help to upgarde the answer which i made 

### 3. Which challenges will a sensor fusion system face in real-life scenarios? Did you see any of these challenges in the project?
I think it's better to upgrade the Deep Learning algorithm to the next level which makes better detection and tracking 

### 4. Can you think of ways to improve your tracking results in the future?
I don't know because I'm not good enough yet.
But i will make better in the future


### For the open3d, i can find 6 vehicles.
### four cars are so far that i can't see closely in same road. But two cars are close to see car's exterior that are seem to SUV, pickup 
### truck  or light car in same road
### Also, closed car like right side in ego's area is well seem and i can find vehicles in opposite road.
